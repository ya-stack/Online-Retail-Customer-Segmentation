# RFM
In ecommerce companies like online retails, customer segmentation is necessary in order to understand customers behaviors. It leverages aqcuired customer data like the one we have in our case, **transactions data** in order to divide customers into groups. 

Our goal in this Notebook is to cluster our customers to get insights in:
- Increasing **revenue** (Knowing customers who present most of our revenue)
- Increasing customer **retention**
- Discovering **Trends and patterns** 
- Defining **customers at risk**

We will do **RFM Analysis** as a first step and then **combine RFM with predictive algorithms (k-means)**. 

RFM Analysis answers these questions:
- Who are our best customers?
- Who has the potential to be converted in more profitable customers?
- Which customers we must retain?
- Which group of customers is most likely to respond to our current campaign?
